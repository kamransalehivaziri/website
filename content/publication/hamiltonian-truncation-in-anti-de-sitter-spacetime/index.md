  Quantum Field Theories (QFTs) in Anti-de Sitter (AdS) spacetime are often

  strongly coupled when the radius of AdS is large, and few methods are available to study

  them. In this work, we develop a Hamiltonian truncation method to compute the energy

  spectrum of QFTs in two-dimensional AdS. The infinite volume of constant timeslices of

  AdS leads to divergences in the energy levels. We propose a simple prescription to obtain

  finite physical energies and test it with numerical diagonalization in several models: the

  free massive scalar field, Ï†4

  theory, Lee-Yang and Ising field theory. Along the way, we

  discuss spontaneous symmetry breaking in AdS and derive a compact formula for perturbation theory in quantum mechanics at arbitrary order. Our results suggest that all

  conformal boundary conditions for a given theory are connected via bulk renormalization

  group flows in AdS.
