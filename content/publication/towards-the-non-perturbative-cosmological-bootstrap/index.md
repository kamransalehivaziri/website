  We study Quantum Field Theory (QFT) on a background de Sitter spacetime dSd+1.
  Our main tool is

  the Hilbert space decomposition in irreducible unitarity representations of its isometry group SO(d + 1, 1).

  Throughout this work, we focus on the late-time physics of dSd+1, in particular on the boundary operators that

  appear in the late-time expansion of bulk local operators. As a first application of the Hilbert space formalism,

  we recover the KÃ¤llen-Lehmann spectral decomposition of bulk two-point functions. In the process, we exhibit

  a relation between poles in the corresponding spectral densities and boundary CFT data. Next, we study the

  conformal partial wave decomposition of four-point functions of boundary operators. These correlation functions

  are very similar to the ones of standard conformal field theory, but have different positivity properties that follow

  from unitarity in de Sitter. We conclude by proposing a non-perturbative conformal bootstrap approach to the

  study of these late-time four-point functions, and we illustrate our proposal with a concrete example for QFT

  in dS2.
